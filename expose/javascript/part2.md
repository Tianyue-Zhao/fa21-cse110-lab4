Question 1: Line 12 prints the value of prices.length (3), because i is declared
    with var, which means it  is defined over the entire function
Question 2: Line 13 prints 150, because that is the value last given to
    discountedprice.
Question 3: Line 14 prints 150, because that is the value last given to
    finalPrice.
Question 4: discountPrices returns an array of numbers [50, 100, 150],
    because these are the calculated discounted prices.
Question 5: There will be an error because i is only defined within the for
    loop declaration.
Question 6: Line 13 once again results in an error because discountedPrice
    is only defined within the for loop
Question 7: Line 14 will print 150, because finalPrice is defined in all of
    the function, and was given the value of 150
Question 8: The function will return [50, 100, 150] as it did before. Only i
    and discountedPrice are defined within the for loop, and they are only
    accessed within the for loop.
Question 9: Line 11 will result in an error because i is not defined
    outside the for loop.
Question 10: Line 12 will print 3 as length. Length is a constant and
    is not re-assigned, so no error occurs.
Question 11: This function returns discounted as [50, 100, 150]. Discounted
    is apparently not re-assigned when objects are appended to it.
Question 12:
A: student.name
B: student["Grad Year"]
C: student.greeting()
D: student["Favorite Teacher"].name
E: student.courseLoad[0]
Question 13:
A: '32'
B: 1
C: 3
D: '3null'
E: 4
F: 0
G: '3undefined'
H: NaN
Question 14:
A: true
B: true
C: true
D: false
E: false
F: true
Question 15: == compares with type converesion and === does not
Question 16: in file
Question 17: the result is [2,4,6], because the callback multiplies numbers by 2
    The new array contains each element of the original array multiplied by 2
