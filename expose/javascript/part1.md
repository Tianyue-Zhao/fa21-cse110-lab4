Question 1: line 9 prints  "values added: 20"
Question 2: line 13 prints "final result: 20"
Question 3: line 9 prints "values added: 20"
Question 4: line 13 results in an error because result is only defined within
    the if statement, and not defined at line 13.
Question 5: the code does not reach line 9. At line 6, the code results in
    an error because we attempted to re-assign result, which is a const variable
Question 6: same as Question 5
